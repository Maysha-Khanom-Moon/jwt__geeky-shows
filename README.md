- here is two types of token
    1. access token  -->  short-lived
    2. refresh token  -->  long-lived
    - if access token expired then refresh token can create another access token
    - Access tokens, with brief validity, carry user details. While refresh tokens stored as HTTP-only cookies, enable prolonged re-authentication without exposing sensitive information to client-side JavaScript.
